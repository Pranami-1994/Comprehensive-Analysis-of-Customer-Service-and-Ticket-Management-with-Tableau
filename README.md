# Comprehensive-Analysis-of-Customer-Service-and-Ticket-Management-with-Tableau

### **Introduction:**
The project aims to improve customer service insights through interactive Tableau visualizations. It provides a centralized platform for analyzing customer interactions, ticket resolutions, and service efficiency, allowing businesses to make data-driven decisions, optimize resource allocation, and enhance customer satisfaction.

### **Scenarios:**
1. **E-Commerce:** Analyze customer service tickets to identify product popularity, track trends, assess issue resolution times, and measure customer satisfaction.
2. **Finance Industry:** Track refund and cancellation requests, pending tickets, and resolution times to enhance service quality.
3. **Electronic Manufacturing:** Identify products with frequent issues and optimize resolution prioritization to prevent losses and improve satisfaction.

### **Project Flow & Key Milestones:**
1. **Data Collection & Preparation:** Extract data (e.g., ticket ID, customer info, issue type, priority) and connect it with Tableau for visualization.
2. **Visualization & Insights:** Generate visualizations on gender distribution, customer satisfaction, ticket type, and resolution metrics. For example, insights reveal common issues (e.g., refunds) and customer preferences for communication channels like social media.
3. **Dashboard Development:** Create responsive dashboards focused on customer service analysis and ticket management.
4. **Data Storytelling:** Develop a Tableau story to convey insights with scenes highlighting priority issues and customer satisfaction trends.
5. **Performance Testing:** Test data handling, filter use, and visualization accuracy.
6. **Web Integration with Flask:** Embed dashboards and stories into a web interface.
7. **Project Demonstration & Documentation:** Complete end-to-end video explanation and documentation.

### **Key Insights:**
- **Top Issues**: Refund requests and technical issues dominate customer complaints.
- **Preferred Channels**: Social media and email are the primary channels for customer service.
- **Satisfaction Trends**: Customers give mostly neutral satisfaction ratings (3 stars), signaling areas for service improvement.

### **Outcome:**
The project enables businesses to monitor customer service performance, prioritize critical issues, and make informed decisions to enhance customer satisfaction.
